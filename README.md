# Tonic

  Every note has its name. We are starting from the first note that is called Tonic. On the first level you will learn to identify only two of all 13 notes:

  Tonic is the note that is repeated twice. What does this mean?
  A note is a frequency. That is the amount of times the string vibrates in a second.
  On the same guitar string you can play different frequencies (that is notes) by changing the length of the string by putting your finger on particular fret.
  And when the same string with same tension becomes shorter its frequency becomes higher, that is it starts vibrating more often.

  The first situation that we will learn to identify by ear is when a string is shortened exactly half. In this case it starts vibrating exactly two times more frequently. For example, if it was 100 times per second before, now it is 200 times per second.

  This distance between two notes when one is exactly two times more frequent than another is called Octave.
  This is the first difference we will learn to hear.
